# Sample Yosys synthesis script for resyn2 optimization
# This script reads Verilog files from rtl/ and performs synthesis with resyn2

# Read Verilog files from rtl directory
read_verilog rtl/top.v

# Set top module
hierarchy -top top

# Synthesize to generic gates
synth

# Optimize with resyn2 algorithm
#abc -script +resyn2

# Print statistics
stat

# Write synthesized netlist
write_verilog -noattr build/top.synth.v

# Optional: Write JSON netlist for further processing
# write_json build/top.synth.json
